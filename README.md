This is the Rock, Paper, Scissors classic game, made as part of my learning through The Odin Project.

It is purposely heavy on JavaScript and DOM manipulation, which is why there isn't any styling to the buttons or text. I do plan on revisiting this project as I continue learning, to see how it grows over time.
